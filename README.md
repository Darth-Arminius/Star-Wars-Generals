# Star Wars: Generals
A Star Wars Card Game Project influenced by Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone along with personal choices and influences.

This project serves as both development practice and personal entertainment. I had planned to start this project for quite some time and have created comprehensive designs for the entire system.

This project is created entirely in React and is (will be) using React-Redux to handle state management. I chose this as I am particularly interested in React and wish to learn and develop my skills with it further. It will also work well with the project.

## Installation instructions

```sh
yarn install
```

## Running the application

```sh
yarn start
```

Details on how to play and the rules of the game will be added at a later date.

Development plans are to create:
* Main menu with "Training", "Play", "Deck Editor" and "Settings"

* Training mode which allows the player to battle the Computer using all the cards in the game or the player's personal custom decks (good for testing deck builds)

* Play mode which allows the player to battle local and (in the future) online players

* Deck Editor which allows the player to view locked and unlocked cards as well as the player's custom decks and allows the creation of new decks
