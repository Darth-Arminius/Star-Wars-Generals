# Star Wars: Generals

A Star Wars Card Game Project influenced by Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone along with personal choices and influences.

This project serves as both development practice and personal entertainment. I had planned to start this project for quite some time and have created comprehensive designs for the entire system.

## Installation instructions

```sh
npm install
```

## Running the application

```sh
npm start
```

## Building the application

```sh
npm build
```

Details on how to play and the rules of the game will be added at a later date.

Development plans are to create:

- **Main menu** with "Play", "Training", "Deck Editor" and "Profile"

- **Play** mode which allows the player to battle local and (in the future) online players

- **Training** mode which allows the player to battle the Computer using all the cards in the game or the player's personal custom decks (good for testing deck builds)

- **Deck Editor** which allows the player to view locked and unlocked cards as well as the player's custom decks and allows the creation of new decks

- **Profile** page which allows the player to view their stats such as rank, wins/losses, total cards unlocked as well as make some settings/preference changes
